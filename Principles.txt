- modularity/versatility (can export/import/sync to/from git/pijul/snow repo)
- can append correction data to existing commits w/o breaking the current merkle tree (edit a commit's title/description, add co-author)
- deduplication
- support for versioning+deduplicing binaries/compressed files
- built-in LFS
- respect metadata of files as part of their history
- same philosophy of sound patches as of git-rerere/pijul
