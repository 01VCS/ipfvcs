- hash-object cmd: detect if its a repo or not
- not only supporting files, also support folders

- immutable log file, that will even contain the creation date of repo

- "ipfvcs add" cmd
- cmd to remove files/folders from stage
- initially missing deduplicing, "ipfvcs snapshot/snap/commit" cmd
- in refs, store file/folder timestamps
- second commit will diff files

- presentation, for ./ipfvcs
- --help flag
- install syswide

- bare repos
- "ipfvcs checkout" cmd, which will also preserve files' metadata
- "ipfvcs clone" cmd (use IPFS, display progress)

- README.md

Insp for deduplication: https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/draft-common-bytes-standard-for-data-deduplication/6813/14

other/to-organize:
- built-in git-meta and apply meta at checkout
- same philosophy of sound patches as of git-rerere/pijul
